#### Console app for integration with Jira!
#### You can add multiple companies, choose projects, see tasks main information, and so on (**in the future**).

### **Why does such a project even exist?**
I noticed that Jira responds to endpoints much faster than the browser renders a picture to me, and since I don't like to spend time (1-2 seconds) waiting for the page to be drawn, I'd rather spend more than a month writing a completely new integration with Jira

# Available features
### **Add multiple companies**
You can add more than one company (company means link with credentials to you private or company's Jira)
Moreover, you can detele and edit.

### **Search by project**
If there are a lot of projects in your Jira you can simply easily find desired one.

### **Search by task** (issue in Jira termins)
Every project has a lot of tasks, so you can find needed one with enter number of it.
> IMPORTANT: **Not all tasks are preloaded**, if you didn't find the required one in the application list, you just need to press Enter in the task search bar and it will be added to the application

### **View all the necessary information about the task**
Just select a task and information will be shown.
