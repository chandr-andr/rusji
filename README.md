## **RUSJI**
#### Console app for integration with Jira!
#### You can add multiple companies, choose projects, see tasks main information, and so on (**in the future**).

### **Why does such a project even exist?**
I noticed that Jira responds to endpoints much faster than the browser renders a picture to me, and since I don't like to spend time (1-2 seconds) waiting for the page to be drawn, I'd rather spend more than a month writing a completely new integration with Jira
